# My Simple Portfolio

This is a basic portfolio website built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

*   Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
*   Multi-page navigation using React Router DOM.
*   Clean and modern UI.

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites**: Make sure you have Node.js (v20.15.1 or later) and npm installed.
2.  **Install Dependencies**: `npm install`
3.  **Run the Development Server**: `npm run dev`

This will start the development server, and you can view the application in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment

Once your app is ready, deploy it to Vercel with a single command: `vercel --prod`.
